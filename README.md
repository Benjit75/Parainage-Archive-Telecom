# Parainage Archive Telecom

The goal of this project is to create a webpage to dynamically visualize and browse through the history of "parainage" at Télécom, that is friendly tutoring groups for freshmen students organized by 2nd year and older students.

This project implements a graph display, powered by a node JS server that can handle visitor contributions (to add more elements on the database in a colaborative way).
